/**
A subclass of this class defines a communication protocol between Push Framework and remote clients (or a category of remote
clients if you are using multiple protocols). Server business code is expected to send responses in form of OutgoingPacket
instances. The framework requests the protocol instance to serialize these instances by triggering encoding and framing jobs.
Incoming data is handed to the de-serialization functions which in turns calls on user-defined deframing and decoding in order
to construct the IncomingPacket instance and its accompanying service id.
