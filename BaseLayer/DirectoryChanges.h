class CDirectoryChangeHandler
/***********************************
 A class to handle changes to files in a directory.  
 The virtual On_Filexxx() functions are called whenever changes are made to a watched directory that is being handled by this object...
 The On_Filexxx() functions execute in the context of the main thread if true is passed to the constructor of CDirectoryChangeWatcher,
 OR they fire in the context of a worker thread if false is passed to the constructor of CDirectoryChangeWatcher

  NOTES: 
		A CDirectoryChangeHandler can only be used by ONE CDirectoryChangeWatcher object,
		but a CDirectoryChangeWatcher object may use multiple CDirectoryChangeHandler objects.

	When this object is destroyed, whatever directories that it was being used to handle directory changes for
	will automatically be 'unwatched'.

	The class is reference counted.  The reference count is increased every time it is used 
	in a (successfull) call to CDirectoryChangeWatcher::WatchDirectory() and is decremented whenever
	the directory becomes 'unwatched'.

   The only notifications are File Added, Removed, Modified, and Renamed.
   Even though the CDirectoryChangeWatcher::WatchDirectory (which'll call ReadDirectoryChangesW()) function allows you to specify flags 
   to watch for changes to last access time, last write time, attributes changed, etc,
   these changes all map out to On_FileModified() which doesn't specify the type of modification.


  NOTE:   The CDirectoryChangeHandler::On_Filexxx() functions
		  are called in the context of the main thread, the thread that called CDirectoryChangeWatcher::WatchDirectory(),
		  if you pass true to the constructor of CDirectoryChangeWatcher. This is accomplished via a hidden window,
		  and REQUIRES that your app has a message pump. 
		  For console applications, or applications w/out a message pump, you can pass false to the constructor
		  of CDirectoryChangeWatcher, and these notifications will fire in the context of a worker thread.  By passing false
		  to the constructor of CDirectoryChangeWatcher, you do NOT NEED a message pump in your application.

class CDirectoryChangeWatcher  
/***************************************
	A class to monitor a directory for changes made to files in it, or it's subfolders.
	The class CDirectoryChangeHandler handles the changes. You derive a class from CDirectoryChangeHandler to handle them.


	This class uses the Win32 API ReadDirectoryChangesW() to watch a directory for file changes.

	Multiple directories can be watched simultaneously using a single instance of CDirectoryChangeWatcher.
	Single or multiple instances of CDirectoryChangeHandler object(s) can be used to handle changes to watched directories.
	Directories can be added and removed from the watch dynamically at run time without destroying 
	the CDirectoryChangeWatcher object (or CDirectoryChangeHandler object(s).

	This class uses a worker thread, an io completion port, and ReadDirectoryChangesW() to monitor changes to a direcory (or subdirectories).
	There will always only be a single thread no matter how many directories are being watched(per instance of CDirectoryChangeHandler)

	THREAD ISSUES:
    This class uses worker threads.
	Notifications (calling CDirectoryChangeHandler's virtual functions) are executed 
	in the context of either the main thread, OR in a worker thread.

	The 'main' thread is the thread that first calls CDirectoryChangeWatcher::WatchDirectory().
	For notifications to execute in the main thread, it's required that the calling thread(usually the main thread) 
	has a message pump in order to process the notifications.

	For applications w/out a message pump, notifications are executed in the context of a worker thread.

	See the constructor for CDirectoryChangeWatcher.
